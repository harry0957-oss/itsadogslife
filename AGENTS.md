Instructions for code generation:

1. Always output **complete files** only.  
2. Do not use patch/diff style (`-` and `+`) edits.  
3. Preserve file integrity â€” code should be copy-paste ready.  
4. Include all imports, declarations, and closing braces.  
5. Do not reference this file in output.
